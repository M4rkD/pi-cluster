* Change results window size....!
* Test transformations that are sent to server
* "Position" the last few nodes...
* Activity page doesn't refresh when ImageAvailable is now available
  - use an if statement to show a different image until the image is available
* TODO PDF test printer (and write a process)
 - Server should maintain a "to be printed" state
 - printer should notify server if there are jobs which should be marked as printed
 - a process runs on a machine and prints the jobs
* TODO Scaling test
 - currently running on 16 processors...would be nice to know how well they're utilised!
 - the simulations are taking a long time (how long...?)
 - Measure them
 - Can I parallelise the images or something?
* Average simulation profile 
Maybe I could have a view of the "typical/average simulation" and our simulation
* Does UI keep retrying to submit simulation if network send fails...? Is there an easy retry manually?
* Are we resilient to things being off/down/not working
* PHASE2 Generating the images is too slow
  - Option 1: do this in parallel (probably 4 times faster)
  - Option 2: do this on the client (or some client)
  - Option 3: Hack together a plotter that can run on the client? (maybe the easiest)
* delete my private keys from the cluster!!
* Pre-flight checks
- what about disk space?? do I have enough?? Should I check before the festival?
* ED Are the avatars suitable...??
* HOME: Client logger should write to some visible console somewhere...
  - Client should retry until success
  - Client should give feedback on success
  - What should the simulation job do once it gets to the part that needs the additional info
  - Hang and wait - but this could be indefinite, maybe we need manual sending
  - Error and allow for re-run - this is probably the best idea really
* HOME : Client submission notify success
* MAYBE Warn if the meshing error happens...
- something that stops but doesn't finish will show as running
* PHASE2 Client should notice if cpu_usage goes out of sync
* PHASE2 Overlay the name text on the screen and get the user to type it
* PHASE2 Can the user choose avatar?
* PHASE2 Drop some submission scripts in place
* PHASE2 Do it all with jobsteps...!!! How awesome would that be...!?
  - preprocess
  - FEM
  - postprocess (two images)
